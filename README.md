I'm Computer Science Engineer since two years ago.

I want to grow up as Sofware developer in differents technologies within the software industry.

Since I finished the university I have dedicated my self to develop some applications with differents ways, trying to respect clean code rules like S.O.L.I.D.

During these years I always try to help people with differents bugs and some code.
